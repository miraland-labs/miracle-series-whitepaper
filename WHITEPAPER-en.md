The old era is leaving, and civilization has entered the era of web3.0 and AI. AI has greatly increased productivity, and web3.0 naturally provides the accompanying production relationship for this revolutionary productivity, which is also the basis of web3.0's argument: crypto-rized decentralization. From web3.0 to AI, the product iteration is accelerating, and the new economic model combining Ai and Crypto is a miracle that is sweeping the world. Crypto digital assets are opening up brand new value space in every industry and corner. In order to comply with this irreversible trend, and at the same time, in order to be able to lead the application of digital assets, we launched this miracle series.

Just as the automobile is a marvel of engineering, our first crypto-digital asset application, ```Crypto-Carfoo``` or ```Carfoo``` for short, is a crypto-craft virtual asset that expresses our heightened concern about carbon footprint in the context of global warming. The car, especially the smart car, currently the first form of intelligent species, is the host of highly integrated and centralized advanced technology; and the Carfoo is the most important digital asset accompanying the smart car, and the ideal carrier for the next development and practice of the concept of the sovereign individual.

## The Coming Age of the Sovereign Individual

The wind begins with a ripple in the grass, and finally, one day, the torrential rainstorm arrive suddenly, and the idea of sovereign individuals is unstoppable like a crackerjack. It is worth pointing out that the future smart/intelligent car itself can even become a "sovereign individual", even at the moment, the data generated by smart driving should actually be owned by the owner in the legal sense, not the vehicle manufacturer.

## Miracle Crypto Asset Project

The **Miracle Crypto Asset** project consists of two core components: the Mirascape Horizon, user autonomous value community and the Miraland Blockchain, a crypto-driven decentralized infrastructure community chain. The former focuses on user interaction experience and user autonomy, while the latter focuses on providing fair and equal trust and value exchange.

## Mirascape Horizon (MSHZ)

As a sovereign individual, any individual, corporate or AI intelligence can choose to join Mirascape Horizon as a member, members are commonly referred to as Mirascapian(s). The core concept and spirit of Mirascape Horizon emphasizes user autonomy, user consensus and user value. MSHZ consists of multiple tribes oriented by industry themes or interests. Corporate members include, but are not limited to, the following types or forms of eco-partners: auto brands or manufacturers, dealers, pop-up shops, repair stations, auto insurance, auto finance, auto leasing, auto decoration and beauty, used car agencies, travels and hotels, food and beverage brands, etc.

**Community Vision: Crafting The Most Trustless Value Community in the Age of Sovereign Individuals**

MSHZ plans to launch four types of digital assets for airdrop, reward, award, or grant to community members:

1. **Community native digital tokens (MLN)** that can be used for community governance voting, carrying community consensus and value, and can also be used for crowdfunding related "voting rights" or "virtual equity" exploration, etc.

2. **Community-derived digital tokens** that represent the credit or value that users earn, accumulate, and use to exchange for products or services on a daily basis, and of course can also be used to map the community's "influence", "voting rights" or even "virtual equity".

3. **Community Digital Collections (NFT)**, a privilege and credential that can prove the user's identity and allow the user to participate in an activity or event, as well as one of the carriers of the user's collection or storage value.

4. **Community SFT**, Combining the advantages of both FT and NFT, this text refers to the concept of NFT-ized FT and FT-ized NFT, which are both detachable and unique.

Community digital assets include but are not limited to: points, badges, game props, community rewards, user virtual images, virtual cars, other digital rights and interests (e.g., redemption coupons), and even virtual shares worth trying and exploring (depending on the degree of legal and regulatory permission in the host country).

The virtual car NFT that the Crypto-Carfoo application tries to launch is evolvable[1], and the growth of the virtual car depends on user behavior, data voluntarily or actively contributed by members or vehicle data.

The community encourages users to innovate and co-create, and rewards to users in the form of digital assets through community consensus, and users are free to dispose of the virtual assets belonging to them.

Members of the community can issue their own Credit Tokens or NFTs to give or provide to their friends or fans for a fee, and give them meaning and value, such as authorized access to the issuer's individual intellectual property, privileged access to private real or virtual space, witnessing and commemorating certain events, etc. The value of the total number of credits issued by a user represents its credit value(if any), implying the widely recognized creditworthiness of that user in the community.

## Miraland Blockchain (MLBC)

Miraland Blockchain runs on a number of nodes, all of which together represent the consensus of the community. Depending on the purpose of the setup, Miraland Blockchain classifies 3 types of networks: development network, test network and main network. The development network is used for the iteration of the community chain itself and ecological application development; the test network provides sufficient testing and verification for the constantly iterating Miraland Blockchain and the application services on it before it is put into operation on the main network; the main network is the real network carrier that carries the trust, consensus, value of the whole community and the transfer or flow of users' digital assets.

Based on the PoS protocol, Miraland is a flexible and scalable, stable, fast and secure distributed decentralized Lay-1 blockchain that largely bypasses the centralized link in other similar blockchain ecologies. The Miraland chain is derived from the Solana open source code baseline for the pan-industry public, and has undergone a deep transformation to fit the positioning and needs of the Miracle series context, while adhering to its open source spirit, following the original license terms, modifying and removing the trademark property rights and its original crypto assets upstream of the software, and extending it to create the necessary resource plug-ins to meet the needs of numerous tribal and industrial applications.

Miraland (MLN) is the native token of the Miraland Blockchain.

Validator nodes are the key foundational elements of the Miraland blockchain, and they work together to form the backbone network. The validators of the Miraland chain handle the network transaction, witness and implement the consensus mechanism, thus realizing the tamper-proof, high-performance and trustless features of the Miraland chain as a community infrastructure in the sovereign individuals era.

The **Miralce Crypto Asset** project encourages users/mirascapians to join the validation node program to create, build and govern together, and lay a rocky foundation for the community to operate.

Miraland Chain defends the sustainable development of the community, which protects the individual credit value of users!

## Future Outlook

Community digital assets are currently designed for carbon-based civilizations and belong to individual users, but the ultimate goal also includes silicon-based civilizations. Digital assets will eventually be designed and built for all intelligent species (whether carbon-based or silicon-based) and are natural and native credentials for exchanging trust and value between intelligent species. Initially, they must be piloted and circulated among individuals in the community under the regulation of a legal framework, in the medium term they will circulate between sovereign individuals and intelligent species, and in the long term they will be tokens of mutual exchange between intelligent species.

## Token Issuance Program
**This plan is subject to change based on community consensus or other important factors before going live on the mainnet.**

MLBC plans to issue one (1) billion native token miraland(MLN) from genesis, 45% of which will be used for Mirascape horizon/community airdropsðŸª‚ðŸª‚ðŸª‚. The annual issuance rate of miraland(MLN) remains unchanged at 1%. The initial distribution of the MLN at the time of genesis is shown below.

The roadmap of Mirascape Horizon and Miraland Blockchain can be divided into three major stages: alpha stage, beta stage, and mainnet launch stage. According to the progress of the project, different digital asset issuance stategies are adopted at different stages.

In the **Alpha stage**, the project team takes raising capital and recruiting validation nodes as the main task, the sooner the sponsor puts into the project, the more discounts he gets; the sooner someone becomes a validation node, the more MLN rewards he gets, welcome to sign up as Miraland validation node.

![Tiered Validator Rewards](assets/images/validator-rewards.png "Validator Rewards")

At alpha stage, in order to gather community consensus, and also as an attempt to explore the symbiosis and interconnection of the ecosystem, the community has chosen to adopt the use of the derivative digital asset **$carbon** as the community's conceptual consensus. $carbon is an ARC20 digital asset emerged in the BTC ecosystem, and its issuance is intended to trace the carbon footprint and promote carbon neutrality, which is in line with the concept of Mirascape Horizon carfoo crypto-craft, and the choice of the ARC20 digital asset is also a extending respect to BTC. $carbon will be used as a mapping and free access to the future community's native crypto assets(MLN), providing a broader space for eco-innovation. The total supply of $carbon is 100,000 mints, each containing 20,000 Satoshi BTC coins, fair launch, free to mine or trade to obtain.

**Beta stage**, once the set goals of alpha phase are completed, it will enter the beta testing phase, when the testnet and devnet will be launched at the same time to fully prepare for the mainnet launch.

During the **mainnet launch stage**, Miraland blockhain is officially launched and the native token(MLN) takes effect immediately. Qualified mirascapians and node users can redeem MLN for free. Redemption is divided into three categories according to the current plan:

1) Free redemption with $carbon

2) Participate in community activities to redeem points

3) Validation node rewards redemption

Mirascapians who hold $carbon in previous stages can redeem MLN for free at a ratio of 1:10 after the mainnet goes live, while still retaining their $carbon unchanged. For instance, one $carbon can receive 10 free MLN.

Validation nodes receive MLN rewards based on their join sequences in the recruitment program, as outlined in the distribution tier table above.

The community points program will be announced later.

Depending on the development of Mirascape Horizon, the community does not rule out the possibility of issuing new derivative digital assets before the launch of the mainnet.
