<p>The old era is leaving, and civilization has entered the era of
web3.0 and AI. AI has greatly increased productivity, and web3.0
naturally provides the accompanying production relationship for this
revolutionary productivity, which is also the basis of web3.0’s
argument: crypto-rized decentralization. From web3.0 to AI, the product
iteration is accelerating, and the new economic model combining Ai and
Crypto is a miracle that is sweeping the world. Crypto digital assets
are opening up brand new value space in every industry and corner. In
order to comply with this irreversible trend, and at the same time, in
order to be able to lead the application of digital assets, we launched
this miracle series.</p>
<p>Just as the automobile is a marvel of engineering, our first
crypto-digital asset application, <code>Crypto-Carfoo</code> or
<code>Carfoo</code> for short, is a crypto-craft virtual asset that
expresses our heightened concern about carbon footprint in the context
of global warming. The car, especially the smart car, currently the
first form of intelligent species, is the host of highly integrated and
centralized advanced technology; and the Carfoo is the most important
digital asset accompanying the smart car, and the ideal carrier for the
next development and practice of the concept of the sovereign
individual.</p>
<h2 id="the-coming-age-of-the-sovereign-individual">The Coming Age of
the Sovereign Individual</h2>
<p>The wind begins with a ripple in the grass, and finally, one day, the
torrential rainstorm arrive suddenly, and the idea of sovereign
individuals is unstoppable like a crackerjack. It is worth pointing out
that the future smart/intelligent car itself can even become a
“sovereign individual”, even at the moment, the data generated by smart
driving should actually be owned by the owner in the legal sense, not
the vehicle manufacturer.</p>
<h2 id="miracle-crypto-asset-project">Miracle Crypto Asset Project</h2>
<p>The <strong>Miracle Crypto Asset</strong> project consists of two
core components: the Mirascape Horizon, user autonomous value community
and the Miraland Blockchain, a crypto-driven decentralized
infrastructure community chain. The former focuses on user interaction
experience and user autonomy, while the latter focuses on providing fair
and equal trust and value exchange.</p>
<h2 id="mirascape-horizon-mshz">Mirascape Horizon (MSHZ)</h2>
<p>As a sovereign individual, any individual, corporate or AI
intelligence can choose to join Mirascape Horizon as a member, members
are commonly referred to as Mirascapian(s). The core concept and spirit
of Mirascape Horizon emphasizes user autonomy, user consensus and user
value. MSHZ consists of multiple tribes oriented by industry themes or
interests. Corporate members include, but are not limited to, the
following types or forms of eco-partners: auto brands or manufacturers,
dealers, pop-up shops, repair stations, auto insurance, auto finance,
auto leasing, auto decoration and beauty, used car agencies, travels and
hotels, food and beverage brands, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Community Vision: Crafting The Most Trustless Value Community
in the Age of Sovereign Individuals</strong></p>
<p>MSHZ plans to launch four types of digital assets for airdrop,
reward, award, or grant to community members: 1. <strong>Community
native digital tokens (MLN)</strong> that can be used for community
governance voting, carrying community consensus and value, and can also
be used for crowdfunding related “voting rights” or “virtual equity”
exploration, etc.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Community-derived digital tokens</strong> that represent
the credit or value that users earn, accumulate, and use to exchange for
products or services on a daily basis, and of course can also be used to
map the community’s “influence”, “voting rights” or even “virtual
equity”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community Digital Collections (NFT)</strong>, a privilege
and credential that can prove the user’s identity and allow the user to
participate in an activity or event, as well as one of the carriers of
the user’s collection or storage value.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community SFT</strong>, Combining the advantages of both
FT and NFT, this text refers to the concept of NFT-ized FT and FT-ized
NFT, which are both detachable and unique.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Community digital assets include but are not limited to: points,
badges, game props, community rewards, user virtual images, virtual
cars, other digital rights and interests (e.g., redemption coupons), and
even virtual shares worth trying and exploring (depending on the degree
of legal and regulatory permission in the host country).</p>
<p>The virtual car NFT that the Crypto-Carfoo application tries to
launch is evolvable[1], and the growth of the virtual car depends on
user behavior, data voluntarily or actively contributed by members or
vehicle data.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/images/digital-assets-en.png"
title="Carfoo Digital Assets" alt="Carfoo Digital Assets" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Carfoo Digital Assets</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The community encourages users to innovate and co-create, and rewards
to users in the form of digital assets through community consensus, and
users are free to dispose of the virtual assets belonging to them.</p>
<p>Members of the community can issue their own Credit Tokens or NFTs to
give or provide to their friends or fans for a fee, and give them
meaning and value, such as authorized access to the issuer’s individual
intellectual property, privileged access to private real or virtual
space, witnessing and commemorating certain events, etc. The value of
the total number of credits issued by a user represents its credit
value(if any), implying the widely recognized creditworthiness of that
user in the community.</p>
<h2 id="miraland-blockchain-mlbc">Miraland Blockchain (MLBC)</h2>
<p>Miraland Blockchain runs on a number of nodes, all of which together
represent the consensus of the community. Depending on the purpose of
the setup, Miraland Blockchain classifies 3 types of networks:
development network, test network and main network. The development
network is used for the iteration of the community chain itself and
ecological application development; the test network provides sufficient
testing and verification for the constantly iterating Miraland
Blockchain and the application services on it before it is put into
operation on the main network; the main network is the real network
carrier that carries the trust, consensus, value of the whole community
and the transfer or flow of users’ digital assets.</p>
<p>Based on the PoS protocol, Miraland is a flexible and scalable,
stable, fast and secure distributed decentralized Lay-1 blockchain that
largely bypasses the centralized link in other similar blockchain
ecologies. The Miraland chain is derived from the Solana open source
code baseline for the pan-industry public, and has undergone a deep
transformation to fit the positioning and needs of the Miracle series
context, while adhering to its open source spirit, following the
original license terms, modifying and removing the trademark property
rights and its original crypto assets upstream of the software, and
extending it to create the necessary resource plug-ins to meet the needs
of numerous tribal and industrial applications.</p>
<p>Miraland (MLN) is the native token of the Miraland Blockchain.</p>
<p>Validator nodes are the key foundational elements of the Miraland
blockchain, and they work together to form the backbone network. The
validators of the Miraland chain handle the network transaction, witness
and implement the consensus mechanism, thus realizing the tamper-proof,
high-performance and trustless features of the Miraland chain as a
community infrastructure in the sovereign individuals era.</p>
<p>The <strong>Miralce Crypto Asset</strong> project encourages
users/mirascapians to join the validation node program to create, build
and govern together, and lay a rocky foundation for the community to
operate.</p>
<p>Miraland Chain defends the sustainable development of the community,
which protects the individual credit value of users!</p>
<h2 id="future-outlook">Future Outlook</h2>
<p>Community digital assets are currently designed for carbon-based
civilizations and belong to individual users, but the ultimate goal also
includes silicon-based civilizations. Digital assets will eventually be
designed and built for all intelligent species (whether carbon-based or
silicon-based) and are natural and native credentials for exchanging
trust and value between intelligent species. Initially, they must be
piloted and circulated among individuals in the community under the
regulation of a legal framework, in the medium term they will circulate
between sovereign individuals and intelligent species, and in the long
term they will be tokens of mutual exchange between intelligent
species.</p>

<h2 id="token-issuance-program">Token Issuance Program</h2>
<p><strong>This plan is subject to change based on community consensus
or other important factors before going live on the
mainnet.</strong></p>
<p>MLBC plans to issue 500 million native token miraland(MLN) from
genesis, 40% of which will be used for community airdrops. Whether or
not MLN should be considered for annual issuance will ultimately depend
on the community consensus, but even if the community consensus
recognizes the issuance, the annual issuance will show a decreasing
trend, i.e., it will decrease from the initial 8% to 1% and then remain
unchanged. The initial distribution of MLN is shown below.</p>
<figure>

alt="MLN Initial Distribution" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">MLN Initial Distribution</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The roadmap of Mirascape Horizon and Miraland Blockchain can be
divided into three major stages: alpha stage, beta stage, and mainnet
launch stage. According to the progress of the project, different
digital asset issuance stategies are adopted at different stages.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Alpha stage</strong>, the project team takes raising
capital and recruiting validation nodes as the main task, the sooner the
sponsor puts into the project, the more discounts he gets; the sooner
someone becomes a validation node, the more MLN rewards he gets, welcome
to sign up as Miraland validation node.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/images/validator-rewards.png"
title="Validator Rewards" alt="Tiered Validator Rewards" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Tiered Validator Rewards</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At alpha stage, in order to gather community consensus, and also as
an attempt to explore the symbiosis and interconnection of the
ecosystem, the community has chosen to adopt the use of the derivative
digital asset <strong>$carbon</strong> as the community’s conceptual
consensus. $carbon is an ARC20 digital asset emerged in the BTC
ecosystem, and its issuance is intended to trace the carbon footprint
and promote carbon neutrality, which is in line with the concept of
Mirascape Horizon carfoo crypto-craft, and the choice of the ARC20
digital asset is also a extending respect to BTC. $carbon will be used
as a mapping and free access to the future community’s native crypto
assets(MLN), providing a broader space for eco-innovation. The total
supply of $carbon is 100,000 mints, each containing 20,000 Satoshi BTC
coins, fair launch, free to mine or trade to obtain.</p>
<p><strong>Beta stage</strong>, once the set goals of alpha phase are
completed, it will enter the beta testing phase, when the testnet and
devnet will be launched at the same time to fully prepare for the
mainnet launch.</p>
<p>During the <strong>mainnet launch stage</strong>, Miraland blockhain
is officially launched and the native token(MLN) takes effect
immediately. Qualified mirascapians and node users can redeem MLN for
free. Redemption is divided into three categories according to the
current plan: 1) Free redemption with $carbon 2) Participate in
community activities to redeem points 3) Validation node rewards
redemption</p>
<p>Mirascapians who hold $carbon in previous stages can redeem MLN for
free at a ratio of 1:10 after the mainnet goes live, while still
retaining their $carbon unchanged. For instance, one $carbon can receive
10 free MLN.</p>
<p>Validation nodes receive MLN rewards based on their join sequences in
the recruitment program, as outlined in the distribution tier table
above.</p>
<p>The community points program will be announced later.</p>
<p>Depending on the development of Mirascape Horizon, the community does
not rule out the possibility of issuing new derivative digital assets
before the launch of the mainnet.</p>

<h1 id="奇迹系列数字资产白皮书">奇迹系列数字资产白皮书</h1>
<p>旧的时代正在远去，文明已进入了web3.0和AI时代。AI极大提升了生产力，web3.0则天然为这种革命性的生产力提供了伴生的生产关系，亦即web3.0的立论之基：加密学支撑的去中心化。从web3到AI，产品迭代正在加速，Ai与Crypto结合的新经济模式，星火燎原，席卷全球，堪称奇迹。加密数字资产正在每个行业与角落开辟全新的价值空间。为了顺应这种不可逆转的趋势，同时为了能够引领数字资产应用，我们启动了本奇迹系列。</p>
<p>就像汽车是工程的奇迹，我们推出的第一个加密数字资产应用<code>加密卡符(Crypto-Carfoo)</code>或简称<code>卡符(Carfoo)</code>
就是加密车虚拟数字资产，借此表达我们在全球变暖大背景下对碳足迹的高度关注。汽车，目前作为智能物种的第一存在形态，是高度集成并集中体现前沿科技的宿主；而卡符就是伴随智能汽车的最重要的数字资产，更是接下来发展并践行主权个人理念的理想载体。</p>
<h2 id="主权个人时代正在到来">主权个人时代正在到来</h2>
<p>风起于青萍之末，终于在某一天，波涛夜惊风雨骤至，主权个人的理念势如破竹无可阻挡。值得指出的是，未来的智能车自身甚至可以成为“主权个人”，即便在当下，智能汽车行驶所产生的数据所有权也应归法律意义上的车主所有，而不是车辆生产制造商。</p>

<h2 id="米兰社区mirascape-horizon-1">米兰社区(Mirascape Horizon)</h2>
<p>作为主权个人，任何个人、企业或AI智能均可选择加入米兰社区成为会员(Mirascapian)。米兰社区强调用户自治、用户共识及用户价值，由一个个行业主题或兴趣爱好导向的部落(tribe)组成。企业会员包括但不限于如下类型或形式的生态伙伴：
汽车品牌或制造商、经销商、快闪店、维修站、汽车保险、汽车金融、汽车租赁、汽车装饰美容、二手车机构、旅游酒店、食品饮料品牌等等。</p>
<p><strong>社区愿景：构建主权个人时代最无需信任的价值社区</strong></p>
<p>米兰社区计划推出四类数字资产，用于空投、奖励、颁发或授予社区会员： 1.
社区原生数字权证(MLN)，可用于共建社区的治理投票，承载社区共识或价值，也可用于共创众筹相关的“投票权”或“虚拟股权”探索等。
2.
社区衍生数字权证，代表用户日常赚取、累积并用于兑换产品或服务的信用或价值，当然也可以用来映射社区的“影响力”,
“投票权”甚至是“虚拟股权”； 3.
社区数字藏品(NFT)，一种可以证明用户身份，证明用户可以参与某项活动的特权与凭证，同时也是用户收藏或贮藏价值的载体之一。
4.
社区SFT，是NFT化的FT，也是FT化的NFT，兼具二者优点，既可拆分又有唯一性。</p>
<p>社区数字资产包括但不限于：积分、徽章、游戏道具、社区奖励、用户虚拟形象、虚拟车、其他数字权益（如兑换券）乃至值得尝试与探索的虚拟股权（取决于所在国家法律法规许可程度）等。
加密卡符应用尝试推出的虚拟车NFT是可演进的[1]，虚拟车的成长/生长取决于用户行为、会员自愿或主动贡献的行为数据或车辆数据。</p>

<p>社区鼓励用户创新与共创，并通过社区共识以数字资产的形式对用户进行奖励，用户对属于自己的虚拟数字资产自由处置。</p>
<p>社区会员可以根据需要发行自己的信用积分（Credit
Tokens）或私人藏品（NFT）赠予或有偿提供给朋友或粉丝，并赋予其意义与价值，例如对发行者个体知识产权的授权访问，私人现实或虚拟空间的访问特权，对某些事件的见证与纪念等。用户发行的信用积分总量的价值（如果有的话）代表了其信用值，意味着该用户在社区的被广泛认可的信用度。</p>
<h2 id="米兰链miraland-blockchain">米兰链(Miraland Blockchain)</h2>
<p>米兰链运行在众多节点之上，所有节点一起承担了社区共识。根据设置的目的不同，米兰链由3种网络：开发网、测试网和主网。开发网用于社区链自身的迭代和生态应用开发；测试网为不断迭代的米兰链及其上的应用服务投入主网运行之前提供充分的测试与验证；主网是是承载整个社区信任、共识、价值以及用户数字资产流转移动的真正网络载体。</p>
<p>米兰链基于PoS协议，是弹性可伸缩、稳定、快速、安全的分布式去中心化Lay
1区块链，最大程度规避了其他同类区块链生态中的中心化环节。米兰链脱胎于面向泛行业公众的Solana开源代码基线，执行深度改造后以适合汽车人社区的定位和需求，与此同时，秉承其开源精神，遵循原许可条款，修改并删除了软件上游的品牌商标产权及其原有的加密资产，并在其上扩展创建了必要的资源插件以满足众多部落和行业应用的需求。</p>
<p>米兰（MLN）是米兰链的原生通证。</p>
<p>验证节点是米兰链的重要基础元素，他们协同运作共同形成骨干网络。米兰链的验证者们通过处理网络交易见证并实现共识机制，使得米兰链作为web3时代社区基础设施的防篡改、高性能、无须信任的特征真实不虚。</p>
<p>米兰链鼓励用户加入验证节点计划，共创、共建、共治，共筑社区运转的磐石之基。</p>
<p>米兰链捍卫保护用户个体信用价值社区的可持续发展！</p>
<h2 id="未来展望">未来展望</h2>
<p>社区数字资产当前为碳基文明设计，属于用户个人，但终极目标还包括硅基文明。数字资产终将为所有智能物种而设计打造（无论是碳基还是硅基物种），是智能物种之间交换信任和价值的天然的原生凭证。初期一定是在法律框架监管下在社区个人之间试点流通，中期将在主权个人和智能物种之间流转，长期看是智能物种之间相互交换的信物。</p>

<p>米兰社区与米兰链的发展路线可以分为三大阶段：alpha阶段，beta阶段，主网上线阶段。根据项目进展情况，在不同阶段采取不同的数字资产发行方式。</p>
<p>alpha阶段，团队以募集资本和招募验证节点为主要任务，越早投入项目的赞助人，获得的优惠越多；越早成为验证节点，获得的米兰奖励也越多，欢迎报名成为米兰验证节点。</p>

<p>在本阶段，为了凝聚社区共识，同时作为生态圈共生互联的尝试探索，社区选择采纳使用衍生数字资产<span
class="math inline"><em>c</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>b</em><em>o</em><em>n</em><em>作</em><em>为</em><em>社</em><em>区</em><em>的</em><em>理</em><em>念</em><em>共</em><em>识</em>，</span>carbon是BTC生态里的ARC20数字资产，其发行目的是为了跟进碳足迹促进碳中和，和米兰社区加密车的理念一致，选择ARC20数字资产同时也是为了向BTC致敬。<span
class="math inline"><em>c</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>b</em><em>o</em><em>n</em><em>用</em><em>作</em><em>映</em><em>射</em><em>并</em><em>免</em><em>费</em><em>获</em><em>取</em><em>未</em><em>来</em><em>社</em><em>区</em><em>原</em><em>生</em><em>加</em><em>密</em><em>数</em><em>字</em><em>资</em><em>产</em><em>的</em><em>凭</em><em>证</em>，<em>提</em><em>供</em><em>更</em><em>广</em><em>阔</em><em>的</em><em>生</em><em>态</em><em>创</em><em>新</em><em>空</em><em>间</em>。</span>carbon总供应量10万张，每张含20000聪BTC币本位，公平发射，自由挖取或交易获得。</p>
<p>beta阶段，一旦完成alpha阶段的既定目标，将进入beta测试阶段，届时同时启动测试网络和开发网络，为主网上线做充分准备。</p>
<p>主网上线阶段，米兰链正式启动，原生数字权证米兰（MLN）立即生效。符合条件的前期社区用户和节点用户可以免费兑换米兰。兑换按照当前计划主要分为三类：
1） 持有$carbon免费领取 2) 参与社区活动积分兑换 3） 验证节点兑换奖励</p>
<p>前期持有<span
class="math inline"><em>c</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>b</em><em>o</em><em>n</em><em>的</em><em>社</em><em>区</em><em>用</em><em>户</em><em>在</em><em>主</em><em>网</em><em>上</em><em>线</em><em>后</em><em>可</em><em>以</em><em>按</em><em>照</em>1 : 10<em>的</em><em>比</em><em>例</em><em>免</em><em>费</em><em>兑</em><em>换</em><em>米</em><em>兰</em>，<em>同</em><em>时</em><em>用</em><em>户</em><em>继</em><em>续</em><em>保</em><em>留</em><em>自</em><em>己</em><em>的</em></span>carbon不变。即拥有一张$carbon可免费领取10枚米兰。
验证节点则根据加入招募计划的梯队分布领取对应的米兰奖励。
社区积分活动后续公布。</p>
<p>取决于社区发展情况，社区不排除在主网上线之前发行新的衍生数字资产的可能性。</p>
