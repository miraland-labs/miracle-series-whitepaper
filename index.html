<p>The old era is leaving, and civilization has entered the era of
web3.0 and AI. AI has greatly increased productivity, and web3.0
naturally provides the accompanying production relationship for this
revolutionary productivity, which is also the basis of web3.0’s
argument: crypto-rized decentralization. From web3.0 to AI, the product
iteration is accelerating, and the new economic model combining Ai and
Crypto is a miracle that is sweeping the world. Crypto digital assets
are opening up brand new value space in every industry and corner. In
order to keep up with this irreversible trend, and at the same time lead
the way in the application of digital assets, we have launched this
<strong>miracle series</strong>.</p>
<p>Just as cars are marvels of engineering, the first series of crypto
digital asset applications we have launched is an innovation in virtual
associated reality - the crypto car virtual digital asset, codenamed
carfoo after carbon footprints. Express and inject Mirascapians’
heightened interest in clean and renewable energy and carbon footprints
in the context of global warming. Therefore, carfoo is short for carbon
footprint points. Clean energy vehicles, currently the first form of
existence of intelligent species, are highly integrated hosts embodying
advanced technology; the crypto-car, codenamed carfoo, is the
topological existence and value projection of intelligent vehicles in
crypto-space, and is the most important digital asset accompanying the
vehicle and an ideal carrier for the subsequent development and
implementation of the concept of sovereign individuals.</p>
<h2 id="the-coming-age-of-the-sovereign-individual">The Coming Age of
the Sovereign Individual</h2>
<p>The wind begins with a ripple in the grass, and finally, one day, the
torrential rainstorm arrive suddenly, and the idea of sovereign
individuals is unstoppable like a crackerjack. It is worth pointing out
that the future smart/intelligent car itself can even become a
“sovereign individual”, even at the moment, the data generated by smart
driving should actually be owned by the owner in the legal sense, not
the vehicle manufacturer.</p>
<h2 id="miracle-crypto-asset-project">Miracle Crypto Asset Project</h2>
<p>The <strong>Miracle Crypto Asset project</strong> consists of two
core components: the Mirascape Horizon, user autonomous value community
and the Miraland Blockchain, a crypto-driven decentralized
infrastructure community chain. The former focuses on user interaction
experience and user autonomy, while the latter focuses on providing fair
and equal trust and value exchange.</p>
<h2 id="mirascape-horizon-mshz">Mirascape Horizon (MSHZ)</h2>
<p>The Miraland Horizon is an ecological community based on web3 for
sovereign individuals, including but not limited to: car enthusiasts,
car owners, game enthusiasts, fashion consumers, etc. As a sovereign
individual, any individual, corporate or AI intelligence can choose to
join Mirascape Horizon as a member, members are commonly referred to as
Mirascapian(s). The core concept and spirit of Mirascape Horizon
emphasizes user autonomy, user consensus and user value. MSHZ consists
of multiple tribes oriented by industry themes or interests. Corporate
members include, but are not limited to, the following types or forms of
eco-partners: auto brands or manufacturers, dealers, pop-up shops,
repair stations, auto insurance, auto finance, auto leasing, auto
decoration and beauty, used car agencies, travels and hotels, food and
beverage brands, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Community Vision: Crafting The Most Trustless Value Community
in the Age of Sovereign Individuals</strong></p>
<p>MSHZ plans to launch four types of digital assets for airdrop,
reward, award, or grant to community members:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Community native digital tokens (MLN)</strong> that can
be used for community governance voting, carrying community consensus
and value, and can also be used for crowdfunding related “voting rights”
or “virtual equity” exploration, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community-derived digital tokens</strong> that represent
the credit or value that users earn, accumulate, and use to exchange for
products or services on a daily basis, and of course can also be used to
map the community’s “influence”, “voting rights” or even “virtual
equity”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community Digital Collections (NFT)</strong>, a privilege
and credential that can prove the user’s identity and allow the user to
participate in an activity or event, as well as one of the carriers of
the user’s collection or storage value.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community SFT</strong>, Combining the advantages of both
FT and NFT, this text refers to the concept of NFT-ized FT and FT-ized
NFT, which are both detachable and unique.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Community digital assets include but are not limited to: points,
badges, game props, community rewards, user virtual images, virtual
cars, other digital rights and interests (e.g., redemption coupons), and
even virtual shares worth trying and exploring (depending on the degree
of legal and regulatory permission in the host country).</p>
<p>The virtual car NFT that the Crypto-Carfoo application tries to
launch is evolvable[1], and the growth of the virtual car depends on
user behavior, data voluntarily or actively contributed by members or
vehicle data.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/images/digital-assets-en.png" title="Mints On Demand"
alt="Mints On Demand" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Mints On Demand</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The community encourages users to innovate and co-create, and rewards
to users in the form of digital assets through community consensus, and
users are free to dispose of the virtual assets belonging to them.</p>
<p>Members of the community can issue their own Credit Tokens or NFTs to
give or provide to their friends or fans for a fee, and give them
meaning and value, such as authorized access to the issuer’s individual
intellectual property, privileged access to private real or virtual
space, witnessing and commemorating certain events, etc. The value of
the total number of credits issued by a user represents its credit
value(if any), implying the widely recognized creditworthiness of that
user in the community.</p>
<h2 id="miraland-blockchain-mlbc">Miraland Blockchain (MLBC)</h2>
<p>Miraland Blockchain runs on a number of nodes, all of which together
represent the consensus of the community. Depending on the purpose of
the setup, Miraland Blockchain classifies 3 types of networks:
development network, test network and main network. The development
network is used for the iteration of the community chain itself and
ecological application development; the test network provides sufficient
testing and verification for the constantly iterating Miraland
Blockchain and the application services on it before it is put into
operation on the main network; the main network is the real network
carrier that carries the trust, consensus, value of the whole community
and the transfer or flow of users’ digital assets.</p>
<p>Based on the PoS protocol, Miraland is a flexible and scalable,
stable, fast and secure distributed decentralized Lay-1 blockchain that
largely bypasses the centralized link in other similar blockchain
ecologies. The Miraland chain is derived from the Solana open source
code baseline for the pan-industry public, and has undergone a deep
transformation to fit the positioning and needs of the Miracle series
context, while adhering to its open source spirit, following the
original license terms, modifying and removing the trademark property
rights and its original crypto assets upstream of the software, and
extending it to create the necessary resource plug-ins to meet the needs
of numerous tribal and industrial applications.</p>
<p>Miraland (MLN) is the native token of the Miraland Blockchain.</p>
<p>Validator nodes are the key foundational elements of the Miraland
blockchain, and they work together to form the backbone network. The
validators of the Miraland chain handle the network transaction, witness
and implement the consensus mechanism, thus realizing the tamper-proof,
high-performance and trustless features of the Miraland chain as a
community infrastructure in the sovereign individuals era.</p>
<p>The <strong>Miralce Crypto Asset</strong> project encourages
users/mirascapians to join the validation node program to create, build
and govern together, and lay a rocky foundation for the community to
operate.</p>
<p>Miraland Chain defends the sustainable development of the community,
which protects the individual credit value of users!</p>
<h2 id="future-outlook">Future Outlook</h2>
<p>Community digital assets are currently designed for carbon-based
civilizations and belong to individual users, but the ultimate goal also
includes silicon-based civilizations. Digital assets will eventually be
designed and built for all intelligent species (whether carbon-based or
silicon-based) and are natural and native credentials for exchanging
trust and value between intelligent species. Initially, they must be
piloted and circulated among individuals in the community under the
regulation of a legal framework, in the medium term they will circulate
between sovereign individuals and intelligent species, and in the long
term they will be tokens of mutual exchange between intelligent
species.</p>

<h2 id="token-issuance-program">Token Issuance Program</h2>
<p><strong>This plan is subject to change based on community consensus
or other important factors before going live on the
mainnet.</strong></p>
<p>MLBC plans to issue one (1) billion native token miraland(MLN) from
genesis, 45% of which will be used for Mirascape horizon/community
airdrops🪂🪂🪂. The annual issuance rate of miraland(MLN) remains
unchanged at 1%. The initial distribution of the MLN at the time of
genesis is shown below.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">MLN Initial Distribution</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The roadmap of Mirascape Horizon and Miraland Blockchain can be
divided into three major stages: alpha stage, beta stage, and mainnet
launch stage. According to the progress of the project, different
digital asset issuance stategies are adopted at different stages.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Alpha stage</strong>, the project team takes raising
capital and recruiting validation nodes as the main task, the sooner the
sponsor puts into the project, the more discounts he gets; the sooner
someone becomes a validation node, the more MLN rewards he gets, welcome
to sign up as Miraland validation node.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./assets/images/validator-rewards.png"
title="Validator Rewards" alt="Tiered Validator Rewards" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Tiered Validator Rewards</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At alpha stage, in order to guide and deepen the community concept,
and at the same time as an attempt to explore the symbiotic
interconnection of the ecosystem, The Community recommends a set of
derivative digital assets for community users to choose flexibly
according to their own preferences in order to build community
consensus. These assets include, but are not limited to:
<strong>$carbon</strong>, <strong>$cryptocar</strong> and
<strong>$miracle</strong>. All are ARC20 cryptographic assets in the BTC
ecosystem. The original intention of <strong>$carbon</strong> issuance
is to track carbon footprints and promote carbon neutrality[2],
<strong>$cryptocar</strong> is a classic form of crypto-craft that
originated with the early Mirascape explorers, and
<strong>$miracle</strong> is definitely the embodiment of the ai-crypto
craftsmanship in the web3 space of the sovereign individual era. These
are fully in line with the beliefs and concepts of the Mirascape
Horizon, and the choice of the ARC20 digital assets is also a extending
respect to BTC. They are considered honorary stamps for the Mirascape
Horizon, and can be used as a certificate to obtain the community’s
native crypto digital assets for free, while also opening up broader
ecological cooperation. The total supply of <strong>$carbon</strong> is
500,000 mints, each containing 20,000 Satoshi BTC currency standard, The
<strong>$cryptocar</strong> and <strong>$miracle</strong> are relatively
rare, with only 10,000 mints available for each of them, specifically,
each <strong>$cryptocar</strong> contains 10,920 Satoshi BTC currency
standard and each <strong>$miracle</strong> contains 16,380 Satoshi BTC
currency standard. As an ARC20 crypto asset, they have been launched
fairly and anyone can freely mine them or buy them on the exchange
market. As of today (2024.02.21), mining/minting is still in the very
early stages.</p>
<p><strong>Beta stage</strong>, once the set goals of alpha phase are
completed, it will enter the beta testing phase, when the testnet and
devnet will be launched at the same time to fully prepare for the
mainnet launch.</p>
<p>During the <strong>mainnet launch stage</strong>, Miraland blockhain
is officially launched and the native token(MLN) takes effect
immediately. Qualified mirascapians and node users can redeem MLN for
free. Redemption is divided into three categories according to the
current plan:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Free for Mirascapians who hold <strong>$carbon</strong>
ARC20</p></li>
<li><p>Participate in community activities to redeem points</p></li>
<li><p>Validation node rewards redemption</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Mirascapians who hold <strong>$carbon</strong> in previous stages can
redeem MLN for free at a ratio of 1:10 after the mainnet goes live,
while still retaining their $carbon unchanged. For instance, one
<strong>$carbon</strong> can receive 10(tentative) free MLN.</p>
<p>Mirascapians who hold <strong>$miracle</strong> in previous stages
can redeem MLN for free at a ratio of 1:100 after the mainnet goes live,
while still retaining their $miracle unchanged. For instance, one
<strong>$miracle</strong> can receive 100(tentative) free MLN.</p>
<p>Validation nodes receive MLN rewards based on their join sequences in
the recruitment program, as outlined in the distribution tier table
above.</p>
<p>The community points program will be announced later.</p>
<p>Depending on the development of Mirascape Horizon, the community does
not rule out the possibility of issuing new derivative digital assets
before the launch of the mainnet.</p>

<h1 id="奇迹系列数字资产白皮书">奇迹系列数字资产白皮书</h1>
<p>旧的时代正在远去，文明已进入了web3.0和AI时代。AI极大提升了生产力，web3.0则天然为这种革命性的生产力提供了伴生的生产关系，亦即web3.0的立论之基：加密学支撑的去中心化。从web3到AI，产品迭代正在加速，Ai与Crypto结合的新经济模式，星火燎原，席卷全球，堪称奇迹。加密数字资产正在每个行业与角落开辟全新的价值空间。为了顺应这种不可逆转的趋势，同时为了能够引领数字资产应用，我们启动了本奇迹系列。</p>
<p>就像汽车是工程的奇迹，我们推出的第一辑加密数字资产应用则是虚拟伴生现实的创新–加密车虚拟数字资产，代号卡符(carfoo)
，取意碳迹追踪（Carbon
Footprints），表达并注入米兰社区在全球变暖大背景下对清洁能源、可再生能源以及碳足迹的高度关注。所以，卡符就是碳迹(积)分。清洁能源汽车，目前作为智能物种的第一存在形态，是高度集成并集中体现前沿科技的宿主；而加密车卡符就是智能汽车在加密空间的拓扑存在与价值投影，是伴随车辆的最重要的数字资产，更是接下来发展并践行主权个人理念的理想载体。</p>
<h2 id="主权个人时代正在到来">主权个人时代正在到来</h2>
<p>风起于青萍之末，终于在某一天，波涛夜惊风雨骤至，主权个人的理念势如破竹无可阻挡。值得指出的是，未来的智能车自身甚至可以成为“主权个人”，即便在当下，智能汽车行驶所产生的数据所有权也应归法律意义上的车主所有，而不是车辆生产制造商。</p>
<h2 id="奇迹数字资产项目">奇迹数字资产项目</h2>
<p>奇迹数字资产项目包含2个核心部分：用户自治价值社区–米兰社区（Mirascape
Horizon）和密码学驱动的去中心化基础设施社区链（米兰链, Miraland
Blockchain）。前者重在用户交互体验与用户自治，后者重在提供公平公正（Fair
and Equal）的信任与价值交换。</p>
<h2 id="米兰社区mirascape-horizon">米兰社区(Mirascape Horizon)</h2>
<p>米兰社区是一个基于web3的面向主权个人的生态社区，包括但不限于：汽车爱好者、汽车拥有者，游戏爱好者，时尚消费者等。作为主权个人，任何个人、企业或AI智能均可选择加入米兰社区成为会员(Mirascapian)。米兰社区强调用户自治、用户共识及用户价值，由一个个行业主题或兴趣爱好导向的部落(tribe)组成。企业会员包括但不限于如下类型或形式的生态伙伴：
汽车品牌或制造商、经销商、快闪店、维修站、汽车保险、汽车金融、汽车租赁、汽车装饰美容、二手车机构、旅游酒店、食品饮料品牌等等。</p>
<p><strong>社区愿景：构建主权个人时代最无需信任的价值社区</strong></p>
<p>米兰社区计划推出四类数字资产，用于空投、奖励、颁发或授予社区会员：</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>社区原生数字权证(MLN)，可用于共建社区的治理投票，承载社区共识或价值，也可用于共创众筹相关的“投票权”或“虚拟股权”探索等。</p></li>
<li><p>社区衍生数字权证，代表用户日常赚取、累积并用于兑换产品或服务的信用或价值，当然也可以用来映射社区的“影响力”,
“投票权”甚至是“虚拟股权”；</p></li>
<li><p>社区数字藏品(NFT)，一种可以证明用户身份，证明用户可以参与某项活动的特权与凭证，同时也是用户收藏或贮藏价值的载体之一。</p></li>
<li><p>社区SFT，是NFT化的FT，也是FT化的NFT，兼具二者优点，既可拆分又有唯一性。</p></li>
</ol>
<p>社区数字资产包括但不限于：积分、徽章、游戏道具、社区奖励、用户虚拟形象、虚拟车、其他数字权益（如兑换券）乃至值得尝试与探索的虚拟股权（取决于所在国家法律法规许可程度）等。
加密卡符应用尝试推出的虚拟车NFT是可演进的[1]，虚拟车的成长/生长取决于用户行为、会员自愿或主动贡献的行为数据或车辆数据。</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Mints On Demand</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>社区鼓励用户创新与共创，并通过社区共识以数字资产的形式对用户进行奖励，用户对属于自己的虚拟数字资产自由处置。</p>
<p>社区会员可以根据需要发行自己的信用积分（Credit
Tokens）或私人藏品（NFT）赠予或有偿提供给朋友或粉丝，并赋予其意义与价值，例如对发行者个体知识产权的授权访问，私人现实或虚拟空间的访问特权，对某些事件的见证与纪念等。用户发行的信用积分总量的价值（如果有的话）代表了其信用值，意味着该用户在社区的被广泛认可的信用度。</p>
<h2 id="米兰链miraland-blockchain">米兰链(Miraland Blockchain)</h2>
<p>米兰链运行在众多节点之上，所有节点一起承担了社区共识。根据设置的目的不同，米兰链由3种网络：开发网、测试网和主网。开发网用于社区链自身的迭代和生态应用开发；测试网为不断迭代的米兰链及其上的应用服务投入主网运行之前提供充分的测试与验证；主网是是承载整个社区信任、共识、价值以及用户数字资产流转移动的真正网络载体。</p>
<p>米兰链基于PoS协议，是弹性可伸缩、稳定、快速、安全的分布式去中心化Lay
1区块链，最大程度规避了其他同类区块链生态中的中心化环节。米兰链脱胎于面向泛行业公众的Solana开源代码基线，执行深度改造后以适合汽车人社区的定位和需求，与此同时，秉承其开源精神，遵循原许可条款，修改并删除了软件上游的品牌商标产权及其原有的加密资产，并在其上扩展创建了必要的资源插件以满足众多部落和行业应用的需求。</p>
<p>米兰（MLN）是米兰链的原生通证。</p>
<p>验证节点是米兰链的重要基础元素，他们协同运作共同形成骨干网络。米兰链的验证者们通过处理网络交易见证并实现共识机制，使得米兰链作为web3时代社区基础设施的防篡改、高性能、无须信任的特征真实不虚。</p>
<p>米兰链鼓励用户加入验证节点计划，共创、共建、共治，共筑社区运转的磐石之基。</p>
<p>米兰链捍卫保护用户个体信用价值社区的可持续发展！</p>
<h2 id="未来展望">未来展望</h2>
<p>社区数字资产当前为碳基文明设计，属于用户个人，但终极目标还包括硅基文明。数字资产终将为所有智能物种而设计打造（无论是碳基还是硅基物种），是智能物种之间交换信任和价值的天然的原生凭证。初期一定是在法律框架监管下在社区个人之间试点流通，中期将在主权个人和智能物种之间流转，长期看是智能物种之间相互交换的信物。</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Tiered Validator Rewards</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>在本阶段，为了引导并深化社区理念，同时作为生态圈共生互联的尝试探索，米兰社区推荐多项衍生数字资产供社区用户根据自己的喜好灵活选择，以凝聚社区共识。这些资产包括但不限于：<strong>$carbon</strong>，<strong>$cryptocar</strong>
和
<strong>$miracle</strong>。他们都是BTC生态里的ARC20加密资产，<strong>$carbon</strong>
的发行初衷是为了跟进碳足迹促进碳中和[2]；
<strong>$cryptocar</strong>是加密车，一种起源于早期米兰拓荒者的加密航行器；<strong>$miracle</strong>更是主权个人时代智能与加密在web3空间的化身，这些和米兰社区的理念一致，选择ARC20数字资产也是为了向BTC致敬。这些加密资产均被视为米兰社区的荣誉印迹，可用作免费获取社区原生加密数字资产的凭证，同时开拓了更广阔的生态合作。<strong>$carbon</strong>
总供应量50万张，每张含20000聪BTC币本位，<strong>$cryptocar</strong> 和
<strong>$miracle</strong>相对稀有，各自仅有1万张，其中，<strong>$cryptocar</strong>
每张含10920聪BTC币本位，<strong>$miracle</strong>
每张含16380聪BTC币本位，。作为ARC20加密资产，他们公平发射，任何人均可自由挖取或从交易市场购买获得。截止目前(2024.02.21)，他们的开采或铸造都处于极早期阶段。</p>
<p><strong>Beta阶段</strong>，一旦完成alpha阶段的既定目标，将进入beta测试阶段，届时同时启动测试网络和开发网络，为主网上线做充分准备。</p>
<p><strong>主网上线阶段</strong>，米兰链正式启动，原生数字权证米兰（MLN）立即生效。符合条件的前期社区用户和节点用户可以免费兑换米兰。兑换按照当前计划主要分为三类：</p>
